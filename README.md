[Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neo-bank-non-sub-churn-prediction)

**Welcome to the Neo bank!**

You have been hired as a data scientist, but the bank has huge problems. The competition gets harder and management has the feeling that churn is becoming a problem. Some initial experiments with simple behavioral rules have shown that customer behaviour can in fact be predicted, but they require you to do it!

Unfortunately data literacy is not as mature as in other companies, thus even a churn definition does not exist. It is all in your hands now!

It is your goal to create a churn definition, implement it and predict churn!
